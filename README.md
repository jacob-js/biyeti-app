# Bookit-app

__A mobile app for tickets booking for all types of events (Concert, Meetings, Culture, etc.)__

## How it works

With __Bookit__, the events owners register their events in the platform and people interested in those events will be able to book them freely or by paying an amount of money specified by the event owner
Using this app is fairly simple, the way for an event's owner to have his event booked in this app passes through 3 main steps:

  1. __The event's owner has to create an account and be logged in__
  2. __The event's owner has to go to his profile screen and click on events button to be redirected on events registration page__
  3. __After the event has been created, he can click on the event to go on the event details page and finaly create some tickets ready to be purchased by participants__

The steps above resume how an event's owner can have his event ready to be booked in the app. For someone also who needs to book a ticket for an event, he has to pass through these 5 main steps:

  1. __Create an account and log in__
  2. __Find the event of his interest__
  3. __Click on one of the tickets showed on the event details screen__
  4. __Then pay the requested amount of that ticket using mobile money (if the ticket is not free)__
  5. __Then as confirmation of the booking, a QR code will be showed to the participant which he can download__
